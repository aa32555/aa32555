```
Expert in MUMPS, Cache Object Script, Nodejs, Vuejs and JavaScript with over 13 years experience as a Full Stack Software Engineer.  I have experience in both the healthcare field and the financial sector having worked on both EMR and Practice management systems. Worked at notebly:


 - Veterinary Centers of America. VCA.org (Sr. Software Engineer)
 - Capital One Bank. capitaleone.com (MUMPS Systems Engineer)
 - GTV.org startup (javascript only position)



 I also have experience working on big data conversions, HL7, CCDA, JSON among other data exchange protocols. I am both a functional programmer, and an Object Oriented programmer, utilizing MUMPS functionally, and Cache Object Script when OOP is needed.  I use Cache Server Pages as a REST API to interface with Vue.js in projects that require Cache Object Script, and the VA Vista Web server in projects requiring ANSI MUMPS as an API. I also extensively use Nodejs in conjunction with MUMPS and Cache Object Script. I am ready to showcase a variety of hobby projects to demonstrate my different skills as a Software Developer capable of working in a variety of different domains, using different technologies. 


 
Lastly, I also used to be the Director of Implementation and training at Advanced Data System when I used to be a junior developer, as I was hired originally for my management background, as I started my career as a safe serve certified barista that moved up the Dunkin Donuts ladder.
